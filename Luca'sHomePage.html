  <p>We are a group of twelve and thirteen year old girls who started Luca's Dog Boutique from a neighborhood dog treat stand when we were ten years old. We all share the love of dogs. We are all about keeping your dog healthy and happy, and giving back to the community along the way. Our dogs are like family and deserve the highest quality ingredients in everything they eat. We also sell strong, high quality leashes to keep you connected with your best friend.</p>
